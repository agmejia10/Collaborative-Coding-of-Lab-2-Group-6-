# Collaborative-Coding-of-Lab-2-Group-6-
This is the Collaborative Coding Repository of Laboratory 2 by Group 6, formed by the members Sergi Cervilla, Francesca Aguilar and Anabel GarcÃ­a.

## Introduction
In this second practicum we introduce ourselves to the collaborative coding with GitHub tool. GitHub is a cloud repository used to develop code, using Git, which is an open-source version control system. 
The aim of this exercises was to create a main project, working each of the group components in their own branch, in order to merge all the information at the end of the process. Following these steps, the objective is to obtain a file that contains all the entrances created in a local terminal.
